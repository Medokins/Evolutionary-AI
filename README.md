# Evolutionary-AI

Most of the game codes comes from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LRI0RLKyt0&list=PLsk-HSGFjnaH5yghzu7PcOzm9NhsW0Urw&index=19&ab_channel=KidsCanCode) tutorial. I implemented jump chanelling, collision and disable player movement while jumping and changed structure of the game so I could spawn many players with individual movements. 

I'm currently working on fixing screen moving while many players are in game.
(I will get back to this project when I pass my University exams, till then no major changes will be made (unless I find some extra time))
