# Evolutionary-AI

Most of the game codes comes from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LRI0RLKyt0&list=PLsk-HSGFjnaH5yghzu7PcOzm9NhsW0Urw&index=19&ab_channel=KidsCanCode) tutorial. I implemented jump chanelling, collision and disable player movement while jumping. 

I'm currently finishing the game and will get to to interesting part -> creating AI to beat it!
